Grains of the golden sand--
Is it therefore the less gone?
Grains of the golden sand--
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Through my fingers to the deep,
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is it therefore the less gone?
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
In a night, or in a day,
And I hold within my hand
How few! yet how they creep

And, in parting from you now,
That my days have been a dream;
You are not wrong, who deem
