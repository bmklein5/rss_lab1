Yet if hope has flown away
Through my fingers to the deep,
And I hold within my hand
That my days have been a dream;
Through my fingers to the deep,
All that we see or seem
One from the pitiless wave?
How few! yet how they creep
I stand amid the roar

Is but a dream within a dream.
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
And, in parting from you now,
Through my fingers to the deep,
All that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
And, in parting from you now,
O God! can I not grasp
Through my fingers to the deep,
I stand amid the roar
